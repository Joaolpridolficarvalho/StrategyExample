# Strategy Example
This is a simple example of the design pattern "Strategy" in Java simulating a payment system. For this example,
we have an `Ipayment` interface and two implementations: `CreditCard` and `Pix`. The `Pay` class uses the strategy
pattern to process payments using different payment methods.
